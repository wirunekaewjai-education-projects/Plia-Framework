<b>Abstract</b>

3D racing games on android platform often use frameworks for development process because frameworks reduce the amount of time for managing resource, handling various 3d file format, vertex skinning, texturing, displacement mapping, lighting, controlling user interface and etc. However, only commercial frameworks in the market currently support GPU programming and an Autodesk standard file format call FBX. Therefore, we have developed a 3D racing games framework, which is the very popular game genres, on this platform. The framework focuses in 3D graphics rendering system using GPU and supporting FBX file format. Additionally, we develop a game name “Wingkwai Huylehuy” to demonstrate and evaluate the efficiency of this framework.
